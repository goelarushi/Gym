# NeMo UserSim environment

This environment runs population-grounded, multi-turn user simulation with
NeMo UserSim. It includes one example task for each first-party UserSim probe;
the examples exercise the environment's supported interaction shapes.

This implementation is the Environment-owned alternative to
[Gym PR #3791](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym/pull/3791). Both designs
start from `ffrujeri/usersim-rollout-quickstart`; this version keeps the native
UserSim generator as the sole probe and tool-loop owner instead of constructing
a second external runtime in the Resources Server.

Environment preparation delegates persona sampling to NeMo UserSim and treats
the resulting panel Parquet as the immutable prepared artifact. Preparation
runs the pinned UserSim package in its own isolated dependency environment, so
it does not alter the Gym or Resources Server environments:

```bash
gym eval prepare --config environments/usersim/config.yaml
```

Preparation invokes `usersim panel`, validates the resulting Parquet, and
writes its checksum manifest under:

```text
environments/usersim/data/personas/
└── 0.0.2/
    └── panels/
        ├── en_US.parquet
        └── en_US.manifest.json
```

The 14 committed tasks in `resources_servers/usersim/data/example.jsonl`
provide one example for every first-party UserSim probe. The Resources Server
validates and loads the prepared panel; it does not duplicate UserSim's
person-sampling logic.

While UserSim is private, the Environment Server installs the pinned source
revision over Git+SSH from `github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/UserSim`; the host therefore
needs GitHub SSH access. This temporary source dependency should become a normal
published-package dependency when UserSim is open-sourced.

NeMo UserSim behavior is pinned once in the environment's typed
`UserSimEnvironmentServerConfig.protocol_config`; it is not repeated in task
rows. The Environment Server separately owns `max_turns`, fixes the Data
Designer output-column name internally, and supplies each scenario's locale
after `/seed_session`.
Dataset rows contain only per-task sampling inputs and optional model-call
parameter overrides. Resolved scenarios are output-only and cannot be supplied
by a dataset row.

`tool_calling`, `safety_agentic`, and `financial_services` expose
probe-selected tool schemas to the Assistant Agent. The Agent owns model/tool
activation only: it returns function calls without executing them. The
Environment-owned native UserSim probe consumes those calls, simulates the
tool results, and invokes the Assistant again when the probe requires it. This
keeps one probe instance and one native UserSim tool loop per episode. The
Resources Server owns persona resolution and verification, not probe execution.
All other probes execute their native UserSim conversation shape without
Assistant tools.
For `identity_disclosure`, the integration gives UserSim the Assistant's
configured upstream model ID so the native probe can resolve and score the
expected developer identity.

The resulting ordered `result.invocations` retain User and Assistant Agent
activations plus Judge, Summary, and tool-simulation support-model calls.
Tool calls and results are retained in UserSim's native conversation result;
Agent observations cover only each single policy activation.

The User and Assistant Agents share `policy_model`. The Environment Server
routes UserSim's Judge and Summary calls directly to `support_model`, without
creating support Agent sessions. The Environment routes UserSim's
`api_response_model` calls through its `tool_simulation_model` reference, while
the Resources verifier uses `probe_scorer_model`; both references target
`support_model` by default. Its endpoint settings default to the standard
policy settings and can be overridden independently.

After preparation:

```bash
gym eval run \
  --environment usersim \
  --split example \
  --output results/usersim.jsonl \
  ++observability_enabled=true \
  ++model_call_capture_dir=/absolute/path/to/model-calls
```

Configure `policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and `policy_model_name` for any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The role-specific settings can override that
endpoint independently without embedding provider-specific credentials or
model names in the repository.

For participant-specific SFT or custom collation, filter
`result.invocations` by the `assistant` or `user` role and use each selected
invocation's exact `request` and `response`. Judge and Summary support-model
calls retain their own roles and cannot be mistaken for participant training
data.
