# Live harness conformance probes

Run predetermined model replies and failures through real Gym harnesses, collect
their rollouts, and apply the existing P0 evidence checks:

```bash
python scripts/run_harness_conformance.py \
    --harness codex --harness pi --harness opencode --harness hermes \
    --output results/conformance
```

Run from a Gym checkout with Gym and the selected agents' Python requirements
installed. Put the selected `codex`, `pi`, and `opencode` executables on `PATH`;
Hermes must be importable in the same Python environment. The versions pinned in
`responses_api_agents/*/configs/` are the recommended starting point. The runner
requires installed runtimes; missing dependencies are execution failures.
Omitting `--harness` selects all four.

No model service or model credentials are needed. Each scenario starts fresh
local model, resources, agent, and compatibility environment servers on dynamically assigned loopback ports.
The existing Gym adapter runs its real harness and normal seed/verify lifecycle;
`RolloutCollectionHelper` produces the rollout and capture payloads. The runner
never supplies canonical steps, joins, or tool observations on the harness's
behalf. All implementation remains under `scripts/` for eventual CI integration.

The OpenCode preset disables its auxiliary title and summary agents through
[agent configuration](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/#disable), so scripted
failures reach policy requests. This configuration is saved with the run.

The suite uses each harness's local shell tool to print a unique marker, write it
inside the output directory, and return a prescribed exit code. Local execution
must be allowed (the Codex preset uses `danger-full-access` in a fresh working
directory). These probes qualify the local adapter path; they do not exercise a
remote sandbox deployment.

## Scenarios

```bash
python scripts/run_harness_conformance.py --list-scenarios
python scripts/run_harness_conformance.py --harness codex \
    --scenario tool_failure --timeout 60 --output results/codex-tool-failure
```

| Scenario | Prescribed behavior | Evidence exercised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tool_success` | Two shell calls, each result carried into the next model request, then a final answer | TE-1–TE-9 |
| `tool_failure` | First command exits 7; a second command succeeds | TE-1–TE-9, including failed tool evidence |
| `usage_omitted` | Successful tool sequence with no provider usage fields | TE-1–TE-9, including unknown usage |
| `retry_429` | Two 429 replies before the tool sequence | TE-1–TE-9, including distinct attempts with identical request bodies |
| `retry_500` | One 500 reply before the tool sequence | TE-1–TE-9, including retained error payloads |
| `model_error` | Persistent 400 with no model response ID | TE-1, TE-2, TE-4, TE-7, and TE-8/TE-9 |
| `verifier_failure` | Completed tool sequence graded zero | TE-1–TE-9, including a known verifier failure |

Both Chat Completions and Responses are supported, including streaming. Supplied
usage includes prompt, completion, reasoning, total, and cached counts. Chat
replies also include reasoning text. Requests adapt only the shell-tool name and
argument schema advertised by the harness. Unsupported tool protocols are
reported as exercise failures.

The runner observes actual retry behavior. A runtime that does not retry the
injected error leaves that scenario incomplete. A terminal error must still
produce a collected rollout to satisfy its evidence checks; a failure sidecar
alone cannot qualify it. TE-8 and TE-9 remain alternatives per scenario.

## Results

Use a **new output directory** for each invocation. Existing directories are
rejected, so previous rollouts cannot accidentally qualify a new run.

- `suite.json`: selected scenarios and runner source hashes.
- `<harness>/<scenario>/requests.jsonl`, `launch.json`, and `episode.log`: input,
  resolved launch configuration, and process diagnostics.
- `<harness>/<scenario>/runtime.json`: executable version or Hermes source hash,
  plus the Gym adapter source hash.
- `<harness>/<scenario>/rollouts.jsonl` and `capture/`: ordinary Gym outputs,
  directly consumable by `scripts/check_harness_conformance.py`.
- `<harness>/<scenario>/witness.json`: independent endpoint attempts, actual tool
  execution markers, returned tool results, and verifier outcomes.
- `<harness>/<scenario>/scenario_result.json` and `evidence/`: execution gaps,
  input hashes, and the existing artifact checker reports.
- `conformance_summary.json` and `conformance_report.md`: harness × evidence
  matrix with passing / exercised / required scenario counts.

A scenario counts as passing only when its independent observations agree with
the retained rollout and the relevant evidence checks pass. Attempt comparison
preserves multiplicity, so dropping one of two identical retries fails. The
artifact reports keep their original retained-artifact scope; the runner's
separate report adds the scenario coverage.

The summary is published only after every selected episode has been processed.
An interrupted run has no completed summary. A scenario subset is explicitly
marked `full_suite: false`. Timeouts stop the episode and clean up its subprocess
tree, including harnesses that start new process groups.

Exit codes: **0** when all selected gates pass, **1** for evidence or scenario
failures, and **2** for execution, dependency, input, or checker errors. Existing
harness evidence gaps are expected to remain visible as failures. This suite
covers the current P0 checks; multimodal content, compaction, parallelism,
transport disconnects, TE-10 and P1 remain outside its qualification scope.

Run regression checks with:

```bash
python -m pytest scripts/harness_conformance/tests tests/unit_tests/harness_capabilities -q
```

To add another local harness, add its adapter class to `episode.HARNESSES`, supply
its launch settings in `episode._config`, and make its advertised shell-tool
schema consumable by `provider.Probe._tool`. Keep expectations and witnesses out
of the task input and preserve the normal Gym collection path.
