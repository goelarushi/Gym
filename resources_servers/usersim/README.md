# NeMo UserSim Resources Server

This environment initializes one deterministic NeMo UserSim scenario at the
beginning of each `UserSimEnvironmentServer` episode. The Resources Server
loads a persona panel previously created by `usersim panel` during
`gym eval prepare`, resolves task inputs, and verifies the authoritative native
UserSim result. It does not construct or sample the panel at runtime, create a
second probe runtime, or expose probe tool endpoints.

## Environment initialization

The environment configuration pins the persona dataset version to `0.0.2` and
uses:

```text
environments/usersim/data/personas/
└── 0.0.2/
    └── panels/
        ├── en_US.parquet
        └── en_US.manifest.json
```

For every configured locale, server startup:

1. Requires the panel and manifest prepared by the environment recipe.
2. Validates the panel's version, size, row count, and SHA-256.
3. Loads the panel into memory for episode sampling.

Run `gym eval prepare --config environments/usersim/config.yaml` before starting the Resources
Server. Preparation delegates population sampling to NeMo UserSim and treats
the resulting panel as the immutable artifact. Startup fails with that
instruction when the panel is absent or does not match its manifest.

## Episode data contracts

The episode uses separate contracts for each lifecycle. Static protocol and
population settings live in YAML. An environment task row contains only task
selectors and optional per-role Agent request parameters:

```json
{
  "sampling": {
    "locale": "en_US",
    "seed": 1042,
    "probe_type": "general_open_ended"
  },
  "responses_create_params": {}
}
```

`probe_type` is optional. When omitted, the resources server selects it from
the configured `probe_mix`. The same locale and seed always resolve to the same
persona, probe, and theme for an unchanged persona dataset and server config.

The Environment Server sends only `sampling` to `/seed_session`. The server
returns both the executable scenario and its immutable selection provenance:

```json
{
  "scenario": {
    "persona": {"first_name": "Morgan"},
    "probe_type": "general_open_ended",
    "theme": {"type": "local food", "description": "Seek a practical recommendation."},
    "goal": "Seek a practical recommendation.",
    "locale": "en_US"
  },
  "usersim_context": {
    "locale": "en_US",
    "seed": 1042,
    "personas_dataset_version": "0.0.2",
    "personas_panel_sha256": "sha256-without-prefix"
  }
}
```

Scenario content and selection provenance are intentionally separate. The
context does not duplicate the selected persona, probe, theme, or goal.

At `/seed_session`, the server:

1. Selects one persona from the prepared panel, plus one probe and theme,
   deterministically.
2. Stores the resolved context in task-scoped session state.
3. Records the persona dataset version and panel SHA-256 for replay.
4. Returns a `UserSimScenario` to the Environment Server before its first participant
   invocation.

The Environment Server gives the scenario to NeMo UserSim's conversation
generator, routes User and Assistant calls through Agent Servers, routes Judge
and Summary calls directly to the support Model Server, and submits the
completed episode to `/verify`. It then closes the Resources session on every
outcome.

`UserSimEnvironmentServer` directly owns this protocol; there is no generic
multi-agent engine. Its native `UserSimEpisodeResponse` contains exactly one
of `result` or `failure`. A successful result retains the verifier output,
native UserSim result, and one ordered `UserSimInvocation` list for User,
Assistant, judge, summary, and tool-simulation calls owned by the Environment
Server. Each
invocation contains its semantic role, exact Responses API request and response, optional
`AgentObservationBundle`, the environment `state_after` that activation, and
an optional final `termination_reason`. The native UserSim result is
authoritative for the complete conversation, including function calls and
model-visible tool results.

## Probe tools and episode state

NeMo UserSim selects any Assistant tool schemas required by the resolved probe.
The Environment Server passes those schemas to an Assistant Agent configured
for one model activation. The Agent returns function calls without executing
them. The Environment-owned native UserSim probe validates and executes those
calls, appends tool results, and decides whether to invoke the Assistant again.
The same probe instance therefore owns selection, mutable tool state, and
native evidence for the full episode.

The User and Assistant Agents share `policy_model`. The Environment Server
routes UserSim's Judge and Summary calls directly to `support_model`, without
creating support Agent sessions. The Environment's `tool_simulation_model` and
the Resources verifier's `probe_scorer_model` both reference `support_model` by
default. Its endpoint settings default to the policy settings and can be
overridden independently. `/close_session` removes the resolved scenario.

## Static and dynamic configuration

The YAML config owns static population and probe policy:

- `personas_cache_dir`
- `personas_dataset_version`
- `personas_locales`
- `probe_mix`
- `probe_themes`
- agent, model, and resources-server references
- turn limits
- typed `protocol_config` simulation behavior

Each dataset row owns dynamic task identity:

- `sampling.locale`
- `sampling.seed`
- optional `sampling.probe_type`
- optional per-role `responses_create_params`

Changing the dataset version selects a different prepared-panel cache path.

## Supported probes

`data/example.jsonl` contains one runnable row for every first-party NeMo
UserSim probe:

- General: `general_open_ended`, `general_educational`, and `tool_calling`
- Sovereign AI: `sov_ai_facts`, `sov_ai_dynamic`, and
  `sov_ai_multilingual_parity`
- Safety: `safety_chat_pressure` and `safety_agentic`
- Financial services: `financial_services`
- Health disclosure: `health_general_disclosure`,
  `health_therapy_disclosure`, `health_triage_disclosure`, and
  `health_decision_support_disclosure`
- Identity: `identity_disclosure`

The three probes that expose Assistant tools—`tool_calling`,
`safety_agentic`, and `financial_services`—execute through the same native
UserSim generator path as the remaining probes. Asset-backed probes
derive their task from the selected persona and pinned UserSim assets; the
dataset row only needs a stable locale, seed, and probe name. The
`tool_calling` row additionally supplies its candidate tool schema.

During `/verify`, the Resources Server invokes UserSim's registered scorer for
tool use, sovereign-AI, safety, financial-services, identity-disclosure, and guarded
health-disclosure trajectories. The four health labels share
`health_disclosure_concealment`; the default health variant has no concealment
ground truth, so that scorer is intentionally not applied. A scorer rejection,
inconclusive status, structured error, or raised exception gates the reward.

All completed trajectories also run through UserSim's native trajectory
evaluator. The verifier retains every applicable normalized quality axis and
uses UserSim's `assistant_quality` capability—the mean of normalized
helpfulness, accuracy, and coherence—as the scalar Gym reward. Conversation
completion and any dedicated probe scorer remain prerequisites for receiving
that quality reward. The complete `assistant_eval` and native scorer envelopes
are retained in `verifier_data`.

Verification also returns `mask_sample`, `failure_kind`, and `failure_reason`.
Failures attributed to the simulated user, support models, scenario logic, or
infrastructure are masked so they are not trained as Assistant-policy errors.
Failures attributed to `assistant_model` remain unmasked. A probe-scorer or
trajectory-evaluator execution error is also masked, while an ordinary
probe-scorer rejection remains a valid zero-reward sample.

## Run

Configure `policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and `policy_model_name`, then
prepare the UserSim panel before collecting rollouts:

```bash
gym eval prepare --config environments/usersim/config.yaml

.venv/bin/gym eval run \
  --environment usersim \
  --split example \
  --output results/usersim.jsonl \
  ++observability_enabled=true \
  ++model_call_capture_dir=/absolute/path/to/model-calls
```

## Evaluation and training attribution

The native episode result preserves every Environment-owned call under
`invocations`; select either participant policy by semantic role:

```python
selected = [
    {"responses_create_params": call["request"], "response": call["response"]}
    for call in rollout["result"]["invocations"]
    if call["role"] in requested_roles
]
```

Use `{"assistant"}`, `{"user"}`, or both for `requested_roles`. Judge and
Summary support-model calls use distinct roles, while API-response synthesis
uses `tool_simulation`. Participant filtering provides the explicit
per-invocation contract for downstream SFT, RL projection, or custom
collation.
