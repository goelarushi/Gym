"""The OpenTelemetry collector that runs beside every benchmark job.

One collector per benchmark job, in its own `srun --overlap` step like any other service. It
scrapes each model service's Prometheus `/metrics` on localhost, accepts OTLP from the job's own
processes, stamps the resource attributes the shared dashboards filter on (`user`, `run_id`,
`slurm_job_id`, plus `benchmark`, `cluster`, `model`), and exports to the configured OTLP/HTTP
endpoint and to `<job dir>/otel/*.jsonl` at the same time.

The ingest token travels twice, as the HTTP `Authorization` header and as an `Authorization`
resource attribute: a routing proxy in front of the backend resolves the tenant from the
attribute and silently drops payloads without it while still answering 200.
