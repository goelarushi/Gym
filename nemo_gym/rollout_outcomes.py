"""No-result outcomes for callers that opt into Gym's structured failure API.

Completed results retain their existing dictionaries, including valid reward-zero and
masked results. A failure carries identifiers and bounded diagnostics, never generation
data. It describes an attempt; retry and replacement decisions belong to the caller.
